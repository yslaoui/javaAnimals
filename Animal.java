//First implement an abstract class called Animal.
// The class should have a constructor that takes the animal's name
// as a parameter. The Animal class also has non-parameterized methods eat and sleep.
// that return nothing (void), and a non-parameterized method getName that returns the name of the animal.
//
//The sleep method should print "(name) sleeps", and the eat method should print "(name) eats".
// Here (name) is the name of the animal in question.
